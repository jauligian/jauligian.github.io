title: About Me
---

Hi, I’m Jacob Uligian, a recent Computer Science graduate from The Ohio State University with a growing interest in backend development.  I’ve worked on several backend-focused projects, including my team’s work on Conspiragen and the development of this portfolio site. I’m always looking for chances to learn more, try new tools, and keep leveling up my skills.

Lately I've been trying to work more with cloud services, and work on projects that help me learn and get experience working in different environments.

Outside of coding, gaming is a hobby of mine and that inspires some the projects I build. I enjoy taking the things I love and turning them into tools, systems, or fun ideas that make playing games even better.
